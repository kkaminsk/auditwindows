## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update delegated authentication scopes in `Get-EntraWindowsDevices.ps1` to use `ReadBasic` permissions.
- [x] 1.2 Update app-only provisioning and connection logic to request the reduced application roles.
- [x] 1.3 Align helper scripts (`Test-LAPS.ps1`, `Debug-LAPS.ps1`) with the new scopes.
- [x] 1.4 Refresh project/application documentation to describe the reduced permissions.
- [x] 1.5 Run validation (lint/tests as applicable) and document results. *(Manual validation only; no automated tests exist.)*
